    <h2>The profile of the Nigerian Beans</h2>
    <p>There are over a 100 varieties of beans known to man. Some of these are specific to certain regions of the world.

        The popular Nigerian brown beans are actually brown cowpeas which are cultivated and consumed in most of Sub-saharan Africa. This variety also exists as white cowpea. The beans are highly nutritious containing good levels of carbohydrate, protein, dietary fibre and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, iron, zinc, manganese and copper.
        
        Brown beans are an important crop which plays a significant role in the diets of Nigerians. They serve as a major source of protein in the absence of sufficient animal protein. There are two further categories of the brown beans namely Oloyin and Olo 1&2. The Oloyin beans have a naturally sweet taste and preferred in certain dishes. It is thought the the beans were introduced to Africa over 2000 years ago but Nigeria is currently the worldâ€™s largest brown beans producer accounting for about 22% of total production followed by Brazil.
